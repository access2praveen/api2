Documentation link to a sample Book Store API [https://demoqa.com/swagger/].

### Task

Please create an automated API test suite for all BookStore endpoints [POST/GET/PUT/DELETE] in your preferred language. Test suite should have following features

* Cover positive, negative and error scenarios.
*	Integration between endpoints by passing values [Create a book, Update it and then delete the book].
*	Add descriptive assertions for each test.
*	Add suitable test reporting tool for report.
*	Add data setup and clean-up properly for repeated execution.
* Follow design patterns for maintainability, repeatability and robustness.

For more information about the usage of endpoints, please check book store website [https://demoqa.com/books].

### Rules

**Don't:**

* Commit directly to the master branch; use a feature branch instead.
* Spend longer than 4 hours on the test. It's not timed, but its intended to be a simple test.
